# Heart-Disease-Prediction


Heart disease prediction involves the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on various factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical conditions.

Dataset
The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset is a popular dataset used for heart disease prediction. It consists of 303 samples and 13 features, including:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Serum cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar
Resting electrocardiogram results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia
Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed by:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling/normalizing numerical variables
Feature Selection
Feature selection is performed to select the most relevant features for heart disease prediction. Some common techniques used are:

Correlation analysis
Mutual information
Recursive feature elimination
Machine Learning Algorithms
Some common machine learning algorithms used for heart disease prediction are:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC score
